#Accordion Component

- This Accordion component is designed to be accessible, easy to understand, and simple to modify. My goal in building it was to create a flexible and extendable solution that can be easily enhanced with new features. One of the key advantages is that you don’t need to manage any external states—simply import Accordion and AccordionItem, and insert your content. Additionally, the component automatically formats text, headings, and lists for seamless integration.

- I'm not claiming that my code or logic is the best. My primary focus was to make the component both readable and abstract, ensuring that each variable and function has a clear, specific purpose, with names that reveal their intent.
